> **歌詞登録ステータス：同期歌詞あり**

```lrc
[00:25.47] I would like something special
[00:31.05] I would like to hold it, touch it, it be real
[00:37.38] Something cool and bendable
[00:42.74] Can it be smooth and react when I move like an alive thing?
[01:12.24] 
[01:01.12] I would like something sensible
[01:07.22] Can it watch out and tell me when I'm crazy?
[01:13.68] And if this thing could be vulnerable
[01:18.97] I would like that too
[01:29.47] 
[01:25.14] 'Cause I would like something special
[01:31.26] Something cool and bendable
[01:37.15] I would like something special
[01:43.34] I want something cool and bendable
[02:00.34] 
[02:03.00] I would like something unusual
[02:09.06] I would like it to know how to party
[02:15.71] Something unflappable
[02:20.97] Can it have moves and platform shoes and know how to dance?
[02:50.47] 
[02:27.23] I would like something special
[02:32.88] Something cool and bendable
[02:39.12] I would like something special
[02:44.74] I want something cool and bendable
